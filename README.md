Development Environment for Web in Java
=======================================

This project exploits various ways of providing a development environment for Java, with its UI written in HTML.
The focus is on client only solutions that require no server to perform the compilation at all. The most functional
application of this technology can be found at

where one can choose one of existing Gists, play with them, compile the changes (inside of own browser) and even execute
them thanks to [Bck2Brwsr VM](http://bck2brwsr.apidesign.org).
